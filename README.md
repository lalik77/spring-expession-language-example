# This repo is a Simple example about The Spring Expression Language (SpEL)

## 1-Spring Expression Language 
According to the official docs, SpEL is quite a powerful expression language which basically supports querying and manipulating the full [object graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_graph) at runtime.

## 2-Adding SpEL Support
SpEL support is provided by spring-expression library which is already present in our starter. In fact, if we inspect the dependency tree of our project, we may see that spring-expression is a part of spring-boot-starter-web. So, we have the nesessary dependency automatically.
